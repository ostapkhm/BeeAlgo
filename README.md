# BeeAlgo

Bees algorithm is a population-based search algorithm which mimics the food foraging behaviour of honey bee colonies. This particular implementation is something modified that bees wouldn't stuck in local extremums.   
Matplot++ was used to save graphs every time when objective function is optimized. 

Plotting example (Egholder Function): (Red - best sites, Green - selected sites)
